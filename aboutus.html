            <p>Of course! A supermarket is a large retail store that offers a wide variety of products, primarily groceries and household items, for customers to purchase. Supermarkets are known for their self-service model, where customers can select products from shelves and aisles and then proceed to checkout counters to pay for their items.</p>
